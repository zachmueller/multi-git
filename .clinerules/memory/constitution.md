## Project Identity

**Project Name:** Multi-Git for Obsidian

**Description:** An Obsidian plugin for managing multiple git repositories, designed for personal use with spec-driven development practices.

## Core Principles

### Principle 1: Specification-First Development
All features must begin with a clear specification before implementation. No code should be written without an approved spec that defines requirements, scope, and success criteria.

**Rationale:** Spec-driven development prevents scope creep, ensures clear thinking, and creates documentation alongside code. Even for personal projects, this discipline improves quality and maintainability.

### Principle 2: Iterative Simplicity
Start with the minimal viable implementation. Add complexity only when requirements demand it, not in anticipation of future needs.

**Rationale:** Personal projects benefit from quick iteration and actual use. Over-engineering early wastes time and creates maintenance burden.

### Principle 3: Documentation as Context
Code, specs, and decisions should be documented inline or in structured formats that serve as context for future work and AI assistance.

**Rationale:** For solo projects using AI tools, good documentation becomes the primary way to maintain context across sessions and enable effective AI collaboration.

## Governance

### Amendment Process
Since this is a personal project, amendments can be made pragmatically:
1. Document the reason for constitutional change
2. Update version following semantic versioning
3. Update dependent templates if needed
4. Commit with clear message

### Versioning Policy
- **MAJOR**: Fundamental shift in development approach or principle removal
- **MINOR**: New principle added or significant expansion
- **PATCH**: Clarifications and refinements

### Compliance
- All features should have specs in `specs/` directory at project root
- Plans should reference constitutional principles
- Implementation should align with approved specifications

## Constitutional Review

This constitution can be updated anytime to better serve the project's needs. Keep it practical and useful, not bureaucratic.
