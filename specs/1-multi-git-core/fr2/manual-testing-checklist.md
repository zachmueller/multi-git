# Manual Testing Checklist: FR-2 Notification System

**Feature:** Automated Remote Fetch - Notification System (Phase 4)
**Created:** 2025-01-12
**Status:** Ready for Testing

## Overview

This checklist validates the notification system for remote changes and fetch errors. Notifications should appear correctly in Obsidian, be dismissible, and respect user settings.

## Prerequisites

- [ ] Multi-Git plugin built and loaded in Obsidian (`npm run dev`)
- [ ] At least 2 test repositories configured
- [ ] Test repositories have remote changes available (simulate by committing in remote)
- [ ] Network connectivity available

## Test Scenarios

### 1. Remote Change Notifications

#### Test 1.1: Basic Remote Change Notification
**Steps:**
1. Configure a repository with remote changes available
2. Trigger manual fetch for that repository
3. Observe notification appearance

**Expected Results:**
- [ ] Notification appears with format: "📥 Repository 'name' has N new commit(s) available"
- [ ] Notification is visible in top-right of Obsidian window
- [ ] Notification shows correct repository name
- [ ] Notification shows correct commit count
- [ ] Notification is dismissible by clicking X or waiting

**Notes:**


#### Test 1.2: Singular vs Plural Commit Text
**Steps:**
1. Create scenario with exactly 1 new commit
2. Trigger fetch
3. Observe notification text

**Expected Results:**
- [ ] Notification uses "1 new commit" (singular, not "commits")

**Steps:**
1. Create scenario with 3+ new commits
2. Trigger fetch
3. Observe notification text

**Expected Results:**
- [ ] Notification uses "N new commits" (plural)

**Notes:**


#### Test 1.3: Multiple Repository Notifications

- [ ] Each notification clearly identifies which repository
- [ ] Notifications are stacked/queued appropriately
- [ ] All notifications are dismissible individually

**Notes:**


#### Test 1.4: Notification Cooldown (Duplicate Prevention)
**Steps:**
1. Trigger fetch for repository with remote changes
2. Observe notification
3. Immediately trigger fetch again for same repository
4. Observe behavior

**Expected Results:**
- [ ] First fetch shows notification
- [ ] Second fetch does NOT show duplicate notification (within 60 second cooldown)
- [ ] Wait 61 seconds and trigger fetch again
- [ ] Third fetch shows notification again (cooldown expired)

**Notes:**


### 2. Error Notifications

- [ ] Notification has warning icon (⚠️)
- [ ] Notification is dismissible
- [ ] Notification duration is longer than success notifications

**Notes:**


#### Test 2.2: Multiple Error Notifications

**Expected Results:**
- [ ] Separate error notification for each repository
- [ ] Each notification clearly identifies which repository failed
- [ ] Error messages are repository-specific

**Notes:**


#### Test 2.3: Error Cooldown (Spam Prevention)
**Steps:**
1. Configure repository to fail fetch (e.g., network error)
2. Trigger fetch twice in rapid succession
3. Observe notification behavior

**Expected Results:**
- [ ] First error shows notification
- [ ] Second error does NOT show duplicate notification (cooldown prevents spam)
- [ ] Wait 61 seconds and trigger fetch again
- [ ] Third error shows notification again (cooldown expired)

**Notes:**


### 3. Settings Integration
